# Unity environment for ChickAI: virtual controlled-rearing experiments
This is a collection of tools for the simulating of virtual agents using the Building 
a Mind paradigm. The agents
generated and studied through this pipeline can be compared directly to real chicks 
recorded by the Building a Mind
Lab. This pipeline provides all necessary components for simulating and replicating 
embodied models from our lab.

## Sub-Directories

* `Unity`: Contains a Unity project which is a virtual replication of the VR Chambers 
used in contolled-rearing studies from the lab.
* `Executables`: Contains pre-compiled executable versions of the Unity project. The 
folder is also where the scripts will look for the proper environments.
* `Scripts`: Contains the code for running simulations of development, testing agents,
and analyzing generated data.

## Projects
The table below lists the projects and publications using this pipeline.
